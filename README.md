# Task-4
 Classification with Logistic Regression
This code loads a dataset, preprocesses it by dropping irrelevant columns and encoding the diagnosis column, splits the data into training and testing sets, scales the features, trains a logistic regression model to predict diagnosis, evaluates the model using a confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve, and finally saves the processed data to CSV files.
